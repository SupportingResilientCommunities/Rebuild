# Rebuild
Recovers 2.0: modernized version of original recovers.org platform


19 November 2018

Project Charter: SRC RECOVERS.ORG REBUILD

Background: The original recovers.org platform was written almost entirely between 2012 and 2014. Since then, it has
been used worldwide and we have learned a lot about how to make it better. Meanwhile, the code it was
written in is outdated in many respects and inappropriate for many of the feature requests we’ve
repeatedly received. Therefore, we intend to rebuild the platform from scratch, in a way that is scalable and better equipped to integrate future needs, collaboration and compatibility.

Goals

● To rebuild the recovers.org platform as an open and flexible platform in order to maximize community
(developers, end users, partner organizations) involvement.

● To incorporate multilingual capabilities in every aspect of the rebuild to meet the diverse
multicultural and multilingual communities that recovers.org serves.

● To add features that have been consistently requested by multiple communities, including a
more-tiered approach that allows community and organization nesting within larger structures,
such as states and NGOs.

● To use current, state-of-the-art technology that allows for a responsive, scalable, website that best
meets the needs of the end user and various organizations/governments/communities which
whom recovers.org interacts.
